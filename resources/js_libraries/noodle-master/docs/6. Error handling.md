Noodle will fire various errors which one can listen for with the `fail()` 
handler.

    noodle.html.fetch(query)
    .then(function (result) {
      console.log('The results are', results);
    })
    .fail(function (error) {
      console.log('Uh oh', error.message);
    });

## Possible errors

The noodle module itself emits only one error:

- `"Document not found"` when a targetted url is not found.

Were as the specific document type modules emit their own but should bubble 
up to the main `noodle.query` method.

- `'Could not parse XML to JSON'`
- `'Could not parse JSON document'`
- `'Could not match with that selector'`
- `'Could not match with that selector or extract value'`
