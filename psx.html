OVERVIEW
This will cover the best practices and limitations for creating custom message templates and give you the ability to create messages on your own.

JAVASCRIPT
External scripts are not recommended because they will not be available if the device is offline. Scripts should be defined in the document using the appropriate <script> tags and we recommend minifying the source to reduce the total size of the document to save on disk space and download time.

CSS
External style sheets are not recommended because they will not be available if the device is offline. Styles should be defined in the document using the appropriate <style> tags and we recommend minifying the source to reduce the total size of the document to save on disk space and download time. The CSS below is not minified to preserve readability.

IMAGES
Images that are expected to be displayed within the message should be defined in a custom meta tag(name=ADBMessageAssets). This helps ensure a good experience for users that are presented with the message even when offline or with a slow connection. It enables each device to cache the images ahead of time to support a good experience. Serving images through a CDN is recommended.
<meta name="ADBMessageAssets" content='[
	[ "http://foo.bar/baz.jpg", "fallback.jpg" ],
	[ "http://foo.bar/nofallback.jpg" ]
]' />
The original image url should be defined 1st followed by an optional mapping to a local image reference.

CLICK/TOUCH HANDLING
Your custom HTML page must contain one or both of the following types of links:
Click-Through
adbinapp://confirm/?url=http://www.yoursite.com
This will close the message and redirect to the URL parameter.
Cancel
adbinapp://cancel
This will close the message.

PREVIEW WINDOW
The preview window within Adobe Mobile Services is not a device simulator. There are inconsistencies between the preview window and the devices that the message will be displayed on. It's possible that the preview window will fail to display the message properly, but work as designed on devices. We recommend testing the in app message directly on the targeted devices.
